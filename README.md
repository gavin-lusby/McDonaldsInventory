# GENERAL PROGRAMMING NOTES

# --> We've noticed some bugs in the console output (presumably because some of the program was coded in PyCharm and some in Replit). The code itself should be fine; if you encounter weird bugs in the console print statements, refreshing Replit and then running the program again should fix the issue.

# --> subdivs.csv does not get modified by the program. It should only be edited manually when adding new products.

# --> Some changes were committed in-meet or commits weren't made though changes were, so they don't show up on the GitHub commit/push history. To accurately reflect who contributed what, we left a few 'edited by' header comments (Gavin and Katie mostly committed/pushed so those edits will show up and be attributed to our accounts on GitHub, so we thought putting them here in Replit comments again would be unnecessary).

# --> The M333r GitHub account is Gavin (on the GitHub he made some commits from the wrong account)

# --> hidden.txt isn't meant to be part of the program since the passwords aren't intended to be stored in plain text. The text file is just for the developers to keep track of the passwords so they can remember them and test the program.

# --> A lot of our functions don't have return values so we couldn't really create testing functions that are based on those return values. Instead, Isaac created and kept track of manual testing in test_log.txt in the folder "test".
